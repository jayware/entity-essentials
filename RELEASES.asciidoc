   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/39[#39]

# Version 0.3.0 (2016-11-06)

## Features
 - Combined components: This version introduces the ability to define components by extending existing ones.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/3[#3]

   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/12[#12]

## Enhancements
 - The ComponentManager does now offer an operation to obtain an instance of a component without the need to add the component to an entity.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/25[#25]
 - An Anspect does now offer an operation to get the internal set of component-types.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/26[#26]
 - The EntityManager does now offer an operation to delete all entities at once.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/32[#32]
 - The Aspect class has been rewritten and does now offer possibilities to specify an aspect of an entity more precisely.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/35[#35]
 - Components do now implement the equals and hashcode operations.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/38[#38]

## Fixes
 - A NegativeArraySizeException has been fixed which occurred when an EventDispatcher was generated for an EventHandler with long or double parameters.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/14[#14]
 - A NullPointerException has been fixed which occurred when state-change of a Query was signaled.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/21[#21]
 - Framework-components are now instantiated eagerly to avoid problems when entities/components get created in an event-driven fashion.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/29[#29]
 - A bug has been fixed where two EntityRefs of two different contexts are equal if they reference an entity with the same UUID.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/30[#30]
 - A bug has been fixed which prevents the deletion of entities, because events which are related to the deletion use deprecated EntityPath instead of UUID.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/31[#31]
 - A bug has been fixed which potentially leads to a deadlock, because queries where scheduled on other worker threads.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/37[#37]

## Misc
 - A couple of JavaDoc warnings have been fixed.
   https://github.com/jayware/entity-essentials/issues/16[#16]
